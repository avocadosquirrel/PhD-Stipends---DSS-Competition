The employment contract feels a little misleading. The contract requires an average of 20 hrs work per week at a rate of ~$25/hr (you only get paid for a maximum of 20 hrs/week).  - You will be working 40hr/week though. Everybody is, and most are also pushing into the 60hrs/week range as well. Fine, it's research, we love it, it's not about the hours. And it's mostly fine during the semester when you have a couple of classes taking up ~10 hours during the week. However, during the summer, when you're taking no classes you're still there for 40 hrs and only getting paid for 20. In reality, you're getting paid ~$12.50 an hour (or worse if you're there for even more hours).  It feels strange and dishonest when I fill out payroll sheets that only show 1/2 the time I'm working. In any other job, this would be called wage theft, but since its in academia, it's considered research experience... Rather than hiding behind the guise of hourly rates, I wish the contract would list the position as salary. ",2,2018,26426,26426,0,0,26426,"Plant, Soil, and Microbial Science",Other,low,0,0

Hosing in Santa Cruz is ridiculous. My single room in a shared 6-bed/2-bath house costs just over $1000/month, and I count myself lucky. Most grad students are spending over 50 or 60% of income on rent.

My offer only guarantees 3 years of funding, with years 2 and 3 coming from TA-ships. Though it sounds like students are generally okay finding funding through a mix of psych TA-ships, TA-ships in other departments, grants/fellowships, or various intern positions with campus departments.

Summer funding is NOT guaranteed. Only those who've passed their comps are eligible to teach and it depends on if you will be available and able to do it. Usually 3rd years on up are the ones doing it. There's rumblings eventually the college will make summer funding guaranteed but they are extremely slow so don't count on it. It's $6k per summer semester and there's two summer semesters. I haven't heard of anyone teaching both summer semesters (usually you're off doing research.) So summer is starving time generally if you haven't lined up work or doing research by this point.

It went down about $5000 total between years 1 and 2, which made it hard to budget. Additionally, as a marine biologist, summer is the busiest (=most expensive) time for collecting data, and I'm skidding into Fall quarter with almost nothing in checking or savings, even while splitting costs with my partner. Santa Cruz is nightmarishly expensive as a grad student-- I paid over $1000 a month in rent and utilities to live in a semi-renovated garage (read: still had an uninsulated garage door) for two years. I have moved in with my boyfriend about 13 miles away from the office. This has blown up my gas usage, but saves me about $400/mo. I am seriously considering starting a side gig to supplement my income when I have to start TAing next year, because I'm now 30 and would like to get married and start a family in the next few years.

4541,University of California - San Diego (UCSD),Bioinformatics and Systems Biology,1.21,2017-2018,6th and up,"We effectively are paid less in the summer. Technically, we are paid the same amount, but we receive less of our stipend during the summer. This is because of a FICA tax deduction for which we are eligible only if registered for 6+ credits. We qualify for this deduction during the rest of the year, but since we are not registered in classes during the summer sessions, we don't qualify. This despite the fact that we do at least as much research during summer as any other time. It seems an easy solution if our department offered the graduate research class during the summer sessions. We could all register for 6 or more credits and be fine. I don't think the change would require students or PIs to go out of their way much at all; I imagine it would just be a question of some administrative coordination.",6,2017,32000,32000,0,0,32000,Bioinformatics and Systems Biology,Other,low,0,0

5492,University of Chicago (UC),Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations ,1.09,2017-2018,3rd,"Salary includes money earned for teaching, which is a requirement. For each class (stand alone) taught, PhD student receives 2 teaching points. We need 5 teaching points (2x stand alone teaching and 1x TA'ing, or 5x TA'ing a class) before graduation. For teaching a stand alone course, students gets 'paid' $6000. But this is already included in the stipend. If student cannot find TA or teaching position, they will receive a lower stipend than the $25000 promised.
The required fees are the quarterly Student Life Fee. If you do not take classes in the summer, you pay $380 less than the $1520 stated. In exchange for the Student Life Fee, you get free access to general physician, as well as events (social events, yoga classes, mental health activities etc). 
Rent in Hyde Park area is around $1100-1600 for a one-bed room apartment, less for a studio or room in shared apartment. 
The University also pays for the PhD student's health insurance (United Healthcare) which covers a lot. The Out of Pocket is $500, and co-pay of 10% goes until another $1000. So if you have medical costs above $1500 everything is paid for.

For humanities students, there are limited resources for funds for conference travels etc. Costs outside of rent/gas/phone bills/groceries need some managing, but everything depends on the rent situation. Many graduate students live in shared housing, and can thus afford a conference every once in a while.

Many students in the humanities have some sort of student job, e.g. working at publications office, helping professors with databases, publications,  working at the language center, UChicago Grad etc. These often pay around $15/hour, but it can also be less. 

PhD-students with families can get $2000 extra a year from the University. This is officially for child care, but can be spend any way you want. This does not cover child care premiums (ca. $1100-1800 a month per child in the area, depending on the facility).

Summer salaries are not guaranteed. There is no extra income for teaching as a graduate student. Students are expected to pay student fees without help from advisers or department. Classes for the first year are full time and with the new deadline system, you will not be able to find a second job that doesn't leave you working for nearly 24 / 7 (also, I'm not sure you want to work nights in Atlanta. It's not a safe city). With my salary and qualifying for FDIC low income housing, walking to school every day and cutting back where I can, I am still not able to afford basic groceries on my salary. Many graduate students in the department are really struggling to get by. If you don't have a parent to help you with this and you can't qualify for food stamps or find a flexible second job, you will have to take out loans. It's really bad.
