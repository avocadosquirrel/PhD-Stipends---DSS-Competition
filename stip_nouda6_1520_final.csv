Summer funding is NOT guaranteed. Only those who've passed their comps are eligible to teach and it depends on if you will be available and able to do it. Usually 3rd years on up are the ones doing it. There's rumblings eventually the college will make summer funding guaranteed but they are extremely slow so don't count on it. It's $6k per summer semester and there's two summer semesters. I haven't heard of anyone teaching both summer semesters (usually you're off doing research.) So summer is starving time generally if you haven't lined up work or doing research by this point.
