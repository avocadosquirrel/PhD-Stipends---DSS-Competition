Summer funding is NOT guaranteed. Only those who've passed their comps are eligible to teach and it depends on if you will be available and able to do it. Usually 3rd years on up are the ones doing it. There's rumblings eventually the college will make summer funding guaranteed but they are extremely slow so don't count on it. It's $6k per summer semester and there's two summer semesters. I haven't heard of anyone teaching both summer semesters (usually you're off doing research.) So summer is starving time generally if you haven't lined up work or doing research by this point.

Thus, $25k is not a guarantee base stipend beyond your 2nd year--indeed, if you manage to teach more, it will be more, but if you can't find a position, you will suffer. Health care is covered, but there is a $380/quarter student life fee you pay for every quarter you are on campus, or unless you prove you are living 90 miles away. You apply for the $3k summer dispersement, and it is based on good progress. I do not know of anyone who does not get this.

7639,Duke University (DU),Religious Studies,1.53,2016-2017,1st,"I was awarded the Deans Graduate Fellowship. Kind of wonky, but it  gives you 34,000 for the first two years period. It is supposed to be a combination of the base stipend (about 22,500/5yrs) + guaranteed summer fellowship for first 2 years (about 5,500) + DGF fellowship supplement (lasts for 4yrs). During years 3-4 I will go back to the base stipend (it will have increased marginally) and then get a 5,500 supplement through the DGF. Students are responsible for their own summer funding in years 3+. The base stipend expires after yr 5.
